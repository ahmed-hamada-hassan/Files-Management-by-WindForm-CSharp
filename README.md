# Files-Management-by-WindForm-CSharp

I worked on this training project while learning Windows Forms in C#. It is an application on TreeView. I developed it many times and added some features. For example, I added a folder and a file, a folder inside a folder, and a file inside a folder. However, you cannot add a file inside a file and specify a space for it. I also added basic files that you cannot delete. These are the files of the program itself.
